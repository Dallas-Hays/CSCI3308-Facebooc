Our project, facebooc, is based on the hartl tutorial application. 

We implement user login, user names, two way friendship, profile pictures
a general feed that all friends can see as well as on each users page.

However, we did not get the accept implementation working all the way. Friendships happen
automatically and do not need to be accepted. We understand this is a flaw but we were halfway
there, things just weren't working quite as we liked so we left the implementation out.

Profile pictures can be changed and occur by default.

User password can be correctly changed and edited.

Wall posts are easily added and seen on the public news feed.

Thanks.
